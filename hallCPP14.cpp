/* Description:
 *
 *
 * Write a program to satisfy the requirements in Starting Out with
 * C++ Chapter 6 #11 Programming Challenge: Lowest Score Drop at the
 * end of the Chapter.
 *
 * You must use the stated functions and complete the Input Validation.
 * DO NOT use an array or global variables! You must use function prototyping.
 *
 * Test your function twice, first with 100, 90, 80, 70, and 60 and then
 * with 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100. The result for both runs should be 85. For
 * full credit, also display what the lowest score was with good output description.
 *
 *
 * Write a program that calculates the average of a group of test scores, where the
 * lowest score in the group is dropped. It should use the following functions:
 *
? *	  - void getScore() should ask the user for a test score, store it in a reference parameter
 *		variable, and validate it. This function should be called by main once for each of the
 *		five scores to be entered.
 *    - void calcAverage() should calculate and display the average of the four highest scores.
 *		This function should be called just once by main and should be passed the five scores.
 *    - int findLowest() should find and return the lowest of the five scores passed to it.
 *      It should be called by calcAverage, which uses the function to determine which of the
 *		five scores to drop.
 *
 * Input Validation: Do not accept test scores lower than 0 or higher than 100.
 *
